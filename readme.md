IYOCGwP, 2nd
============

I was following along with Invent Your Own Computer Game with Python, 2nd Edition, by [Albert Sweigart](http://coffeeghost.net). Since it uses Python 3 and I've since learned not to learn Python 3 before 2.x, I've postponed the project.

The book can be viewed [here](http://inventwithpython.com).
